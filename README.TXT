Pads files to any multiple. Useful for build scripts where ROM padding using assembler directives isn't practical.

To compile/install, use either "go build pad.go" (local directories) or "go install github.com/megabrew/pad@latest" (global). The Go toolchain (https://go.dev/dl/) must be installed on your system; on Windows, the necessary directories will be added to your PATH automatically.
